## Data Structures
The repository includes implementations for the following data structures:
- Linked List (e.g., Single Linked List, Double Linked List, Circular Linked List)
- Graph (e.g, Graph Implement and route finding algorithm)
- Tree: (e.g, Red-Black Tree, AVL Tree, BST Tree)

## Algorithm
The repository covers various algorithms, including:
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- Greedy algorithms (e.g., Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm)

## Practice
The repository includes 2 sub-modules to 2 repositories containing my practice code while studying at the **Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology**.
- [Open-coding-PTIT](https://github.com/Tuanpluss02/Open-coding-PTIT.git)
- [DSA-PTIT](https://github.com/Tuanpluss02/DSA-PTIT.git)

## Acknowledgments
This repository is inspired by the curriculum of computer science courses and popular algorithm textbooks.
Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources and references.
